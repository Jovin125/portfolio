This is a school project for coding a shopping cart system. Which my teammate and I completed. 

I coded the first part of the program which includes setting up all the variables and the last part i coded for was the Cart page

I do not know if my teammate from this project has github, and I do not know if they are fine if i were to put their name here...

Example images of pages:
